Named Branches
==============

An implementation of `hg-style named
branches <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/NamedBranches>`_ implemented via
`GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_ plus `git notes
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes>`_.

This mostly exists as a POC at the minute, to perhaps help `PyPy
<https://www.pypy.org/>`_ move off of `BitBucket
<https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket>`_.
